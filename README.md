## Reflection

Denisse - README.md, Routing, Home page and Manga

Lawrence - Github leader, Comments Component

Juan - Wireframe, Anime page

This was a quick 4 day trio group project done by team Dj Lawjuan during our third module at Per Scholas. Our project goal included utilizing technologies learned up until this point, while also gaining knowledge and usage of new packages/tools.

Technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Axios. Also JavaScript, JSX, Firebase, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, and CSS. We utilized create-react-app due to ease of usage and time effectiveness.

Issues during production sourced from our initial API choice. We were having a hard time understanding how to access this specific API. Firebase was self-taught in order to get the comment section to work correctly.
