This was a quick 4 day trio group project done by team Dj Lawjuan during our third module at Per Scholas. Our project goal included utilizing technologies learned up until this point while also gaining knowledge and usage of new packages/tools.

Technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Axios. Also JavaScript, JSX, Firebase, Bootstrap, and CSS. We utilized create-react-app due to ease of usage and time effectiveness.

Issues during production sourced from our initial API choice. We were having a hard time understanding how to access this specific API.
